    <p> Climate change occurs when changes in Earth's climate system result in new weather patterns that last for at least a few decades, and maybe for millions of years. The climate system is comprised of five interacting parts, the atmosphere (air), hydrosphere (water), cryosphere (ice and permafrost), biosphere (living things), and lithosphere (earth's crust and upper mantle). The climate system receives nearly all of its energy from the sun, with a relatively tiny amount from earth's interior. <span class="note">The climate system also gives off energy to outer space.</span> The balance of incoming and outgoing energy, and the passage of the energy through the climate system, determines Earth's energy budget. When the incoming energy is greater than the outgoing energy, earth's energy budget is positive and the climate system is warming. If more energy goes out, the energy budget is negative and earth experiences cooling.<p>

    <h3>Life</h3>
Life affects climate through its role in the carbon and water cycles and through such mechanisms as albedo, evapotranspiration, cloud formation, and weathering.Examples of how life may have affected past climate include:
<ol>
  <li>glaciation 2.3 billion years ago triggered by the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis, which depleted the atmosphere of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and introduced free oxygen.</li>
<li>another glaciation 300 million years ago ushered in by long-term burial of decomposition-resistant detritus of vascular land-plants (creating a carbon sink and forming coal)</li>
<li>termination of the Paleoceneâ€“Eocene Thermal Maximum 55 million years ago by flourishing marine phytoplankton.</li>
 <li>reversal of global warming 49 million years ago by 800,000 years of arctic azolla blooms.</li>
<li>global cooling over the past 40 million years driven by the expansion of grass-grazer ecosystems.</li>
