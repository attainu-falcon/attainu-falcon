Why_I_Want_To_Be_A_Programmer?

I will like to give a very few reasons about what i feel of the world we live-in first.

The world that i know I realise, I dont know it at-all. The more I read the autobiographies, Quora. The more I surf the net and even when simply gaze out of the window of the bus I just boarded. I realise its forever changing. Nothing is stagnant. 

May be coding can help me convey the same to a few more people of what I see, and also what I want to see. And vice-versa.

Coding can be my vehicle to greater truth and service. Well, I hope so. There are so many problem, apps can literally solve them. 

It is a new dimension. The mind can think in terms of code someday. More logically without losing the soulfulness. 

Honestly, I dont know if I want to be a programmer. But I would like to seek its truth. I am a spirited-learner. May be I can do some good here. Lets see!
