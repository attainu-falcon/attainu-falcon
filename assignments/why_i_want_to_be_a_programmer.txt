I choose computer science as it was most sought branch at that
time. no particular thought, really but as I started learnin 
then I fall in love with computers. It gives you power to do certain
things that are most amazing for amature people. How we see mobile games
and how normally people with no programming experience see tells the
story itself.

To work from your computer and be able to make something that people
will use for their convenience in daily life sounds amazing. isn't it?
