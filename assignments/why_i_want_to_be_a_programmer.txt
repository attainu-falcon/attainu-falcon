After taking Science in 11th i had 2 choices either take bio 
and hindi or take maths with computer science. Since it was
a clear choice that i wanted maths over bio but had no idea 
of Computer Science subject.Still i took it.CS lectures where
mainly fun after than becuase we used to play Counter Strike on
lab pc and was allowed to only those who completes or learn
code and problem given that day. Since to play lot more
i completed C++ early and got coded early with other friends
and started gaming. I loved it. But main Thing i used to 
learn here that i saw it a creation. That dope moment when 
logic hits ur head i loved it.i then mastered C language
and started solving competitive question in college but i couldn't
get correct most of it.Of all the things which i could do I enjoy
doing coding and don't care however lame it might go.Also I mostly
surf on internet watching startup videos and how they worked
on it.The most inspiring one was how Bill Gates and Steve Jobs
rivalry has given a great Personal Computing Era.This inspire 
me a lot.I believe someday more breakthrough is going to happen
maybe in quantum computing,AI etc. But when it happens i Want to 
witness it and be a part of it or maybe start it and could
contribute to Humanity.
