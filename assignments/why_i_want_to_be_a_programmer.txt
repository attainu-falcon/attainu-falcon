I reason I wanted to be a programmer is because from the very
begining during the school days. When I had a new computer at
my home, I used to be very fond of it. Downloading softwares
playing games. But the thought of becoming a programmer came 
with all the things I installed on my computer and the websites 
I visited. I always had a feeling of how it is working, how to
make a website of my own. So during the 10th grade in school,
I researched about html, when I had no idea what it was nothing aabout
it. I created a website using html. The website was for downloading 
songs. I then uploaded it to a free webhosting site. It was not 
that a good one. But the idea fascinated me to try more and learn more
and to do better. Then later I pursued my career with computer science.
