I have always been a very curious person growing up so naturally I was always playing with things that were not always my toys and that built a knack to see how things were built or how it works.

Keeping that desire to create something with function and purpose I found that engineering would be a great option for me,but unfortunately I realised I wouldn't get a good core job.

So I realaised that I could fulfill part of my desire by becoming a programmer where I can create virtual things which would still have a functioning purpose.So I looked into it in my final year of engineering and now I am on a long road in becoming a good programmer.

What kept hooked up with programming was when I could see my code transform into visual's and the fact that I can create anything I can imagine.
