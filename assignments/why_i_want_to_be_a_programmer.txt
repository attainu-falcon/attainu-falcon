I have an immense love for coding and the reason is being able to code is like having a supernatural power,you can literally create anything from scratch.
It’s crazy how few lines of code can make a machine do anything we want. 
 If you want that the lights of your room should automatically be switched off as soon as you leave the room , if you want your mobile phone to automatically send emails and messages , 
 even if you want to make a robot for yourself to do all the hard work , everything seems possible when you know how to program.
Now imagine you had an idea for an application
It would cost you… Nothing! If you get specialist software, or hire extra hands, it will cost you.
but it’s possible to create an amazing piece of software with merely you and your computer.
It takes time, and skill, but by the end what you have is worth it.
That's why I wanted to be a coder. Life is all about educating yourself.
In this digital age coding is as important as learning a language to communicate with the world.
