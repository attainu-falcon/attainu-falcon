Passion is one key ingredient of being good in any profession.

You will learn every day Every day you’ll be presented with new challenges. You’re an engineer working on potentially very complex problems.
You need to know how to figure things out, and if you don’t, you need to learn it on the job.
You are expected to be learning every day, and this is awesome as you’re not stagnating in the job market but building up lots of experience as the time passes. Valuable experience for your company, other companies if you decide to switch jobs, or even for yourself if you want to try going indie.
Being required to learn every day can either be frustrating, or very exciting. It all depends on your mindset.
