    <div class="about">
      <p>Hello World,
        My name is Alok Hazarika and I’m 29 years old guy from Jorhat, Assam.
         I started my career as a Network Support Technician in a Internet Service Provider
          named ‘City Broadband’ in Jorhat in the year 2011. I didn’t have the required
          skills for a network technician but I promised my boss that I’ll learn the
          required skills in very short time. Thanks to one of my senior and friend Tafruz,
           that I eventually got the concepts of IP, MAC address, Dynamic and Static IP,
           bandwidth, DNS, DHCP, IP gateway and so on. After two moths I started going
           independently towards the problem sites. After then, I started learning about
           fiber optics - splicing, using OTDR etc. But due to scenarios of fiber cuts and
            time requirements in laying optical fibers we started Air Broadband also. Then
            I came through the concepts of 2.7 gHz and 5.0 gHz radio transmissions. Things
            were going on well at that time. And there came the time when a advertisement
            was published in the website of ONGC ltd. a major Oil and Gas company of India.
           I applied and after three rounds of interview I got selected as a Winch Operator
            and I joined the reputed company on 30.06.2016. Again I had to learn new set of
            skills for the operations of oil well drilling, studying reservoir pressures and
            carry out various studies across the wells of ONGC Jorhat Oilfields. Our team
            performed excellently and got the group award as the best Sub-Surface Team of
            ONGC. Now came the time when I got impressed by coding which has the ability
            to solve the problems of society. Although I was in a comfortable state and would be as the company pays well along with other facilities but I decided to quit and start my journey in the field of web development and specially web apps. So I tried with Youtube tutorials and free courses available in the internet but as you can see it’s not a proper way of learning. One must learn by doing and keep doing. Eventually I found out AttainU Program and got very excited. Yes! This the the platform I was looking for. So, I signed up and here we are.</p>
               <p> I like watching good movies and got insiperd by the good messages
               the movies carry. I'm also fond of riding motorcycle and when I can manage
             I always try to explore the places with natural beauty. I am also a farmer and I
           am currenly growing vegetables by organic procedures in my farming area.</p>
