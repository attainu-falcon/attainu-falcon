            <p>Hi, my name is Amey.I'm currently living in mumbai.So I've done my diploma in mechanical engineering as I always had more interest in computers I started off my journey by getting into website designing in the year 2018. Back then I started website designing by understanding wordpress and basic html and css. As I found coding was something that I want to do in future I decided to opt for this course.So this little information is about me. Apart from this I enjoy going to the gym and staying healthy and fit. </p>
